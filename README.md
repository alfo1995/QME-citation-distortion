# Citation distortion through graph analysis

*Are the authors' rankings based on citations really effective, as is commonly led to thinking?*

 With our analysis, based on Graph Theory, we were able to identify some
  critical issues (distortions) that we tried to solve for obtaining a
more realistic idea of the importance that has an author in the field of
                            computer science.
      Analyzing the data provided by Incites we obtained temporal,
    geographical and distribution information of the citations of the
       authors of our interest, verifying the presence of possible
                              correlations.
     To recreate a possible situation in which there is presence of
  distortion, we have generated a subgraph starting from an author and
 using hop distance equal to 5; through the latter we managed to extract
the characteristics that highlight the presence of distortion within the
                      scientific field of interest.
After that, our team developed a model, using the graph theory, to solve
 or at least reduce, the two main types of distortion, the self-citation
        and the Exchanging Citation using a graph-based approach.
